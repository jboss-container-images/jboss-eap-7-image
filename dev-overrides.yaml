# dev-overrides.yaml

# Example artifact image.yaml overrides:
# concreate --overrides=dev-overrides.yaml
# cekit build --overrides-file dev-overrides.yaml
#
# During image building, files that do not specify an absolute path, or URL are expected to be found
# in the directory target/image/ in the current build directory. You may copy files directly into this directory,
# or provide absolute paths to the source files, and the build process will copy them to this location.
#
# If you provide a hash value, and the file is not found locally, the configured caching service will be queried
# for a matching artifact (see ~/.concreate or ~/.cekit for the configured cache location.)
#
# Note in both examples below the target file will be renamed to jboss-eap-cd.zip
# in target/image as that is the filename expected by the EAP install script.
